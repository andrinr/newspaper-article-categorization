# Newspaper article categorization
*A data science project*

During this project we have tried to analyze a dataset obtained from huffpost containing roughly 200'000 newspaper articles, including headline, description, category and publication date. Using the headline and/or description words we tried to predict the human labeled categories using word embeddings and common machine learning models.
